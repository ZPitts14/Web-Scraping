# Web_scraping
Complete your initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.

Create a Jupyter Notebook file called mission_to_mars.ipynb and use this to complete all of your scraping and analysis tasks. The following outlines what you need to scrape.
NASA Mars News
Scrape the NASA Mars News Site and collect the latest News Title and Paragraph Text. Assign the text to variables that you can reference later.

Use Pandas to convert the data to a HTML table string.

Mars Hemispheres
Visit the USGS Astrogeology site here to obtain high resolution images for each of Mar's hemispheres.

You will need to click each of the links to the hemispheres in order to find the image url to the full resolution image.

Save both the image url string for the full resolution hemisphere image, and the Hemisphere title containing the hemisphere name. Use a Python dictionary to store the data using the keys img_url and title.

Append the dictionary with the image url string and the hemisphere title to a list. This list will contain one dictionary for each hemisphere.
